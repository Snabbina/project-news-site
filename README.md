First real programming project ever! Fokus to create a news site with responsive layout, using flexbox.

## The problem

Used html, css. Did a skets by hand and got inspiration from the added newssketch image. flexbox, grid, media quariy if more time (and knowlege) I would fokus more on a mor sophisticated design and interactivity.
