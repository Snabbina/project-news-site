# News Site
Used html, css. Did a skets by hand and got inspiration from the added newssketch image. flexbox, grid, media quariy if more time (and knowlege) I would fokus more on a more sophisticated design and interactivity. 
Hade trouble getting my content to position itself nicely based on different break points.

## The problem

First real programming project ever! Fokus to create a colorfull magazine like news site with responsive layout using html and css, and layout method flexbox. How its shown in different browsers. Tested mostly in chrome and with dev-inspector responsivnes tool.
